      <p>Understanding how the brain learns changes the way we teach. Learning is a biological process guided by memory, attention, and emotion, and the classroom environment influences each of these systems. When teachers recognise that novices and experts think differently, that working memory is limited, and that the brain rewires itself through practice, instructional choices can become more intentional. The evidence consistently supports approaches that reduce unnecessary cognitive load, build strong schemas, and create the safety required for new learning to take hold.</p>
      
      <p>When translated into practical teaching methods, explicit instruction, careful sequencing, worked examples, and gradual release are widely used pedagogical practices which align closely with neuroscience. Classrooms built on predictability, connection, and emotional safety allow the amygdala to stay settled, ensuring that new information can move towards long-term memory. By contrast, approaches built on common neuromyths pull attention away from these foundations; setting aside ideas like learning styles or left–right brain dominance sharpens the focus on techniques that genuinely support learning.</p>
      
      <p>Together, these insights show that effective teaching is not about adding more complexity, but about aligning everyday teaching decisions with the brain’s natural architecture. In doing so, teachers can cultivate minds suitable for even the most discerning undead diner.</p>
